Haven't you ever wanted an in-app purchase one liner that looks like this ?!

```cpp
soomla::CCStoreInventory::sharedStoreInventory()->buyItem("[itemId]", NULL);
```

cocos2dx-store is the Cocos2d-x flavor of SOOMLA's Store Module.

## Economy Model
![SOOMLA's Economy Model](http://know.soom.la/img/tutorial_img/soomla_diagrams/EconomyModel.png)

## Example Project

A simple example project to show you some basic usage of cocos2dx-store: http://github.com/soomla/cocos2dx-store-example

This example is still under development but it can give you a taste of the important aspects of the framework.

## Download

####Pre baked zip:

- [soomla-cocos2dx-core 1.2.1](http://library.soom.la/fetch/cocos2dx-core/1.2.1?cf=github)
- [cocos2dx-store 4.5.1](http://library.soom.la/fetch/cocos2dx-store/4.5.1?cf=github)

## Getting Started (With pre-built libraries)

*If you want to develop with sources, refer to the [Working with sources](https://github.com/soomla/cocos2dx-store#working-with-sources) section below*

> If you didn't do that already, clone the Cocos2d-x framework from [here](https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x) or download it from the [Cocos2d-x website](http://www.cocos2d-x.org/download). Make sure the version you clone is supported by cocos2dx-store (the tag is the version).

1. Clone [soomla-cocos2dx-core](https://github.com/soomla/soomla-cocos2dx-core) and cocos2dx-store into the `extensions` folder located at the root of your Cocos2d-x framework.
    ```
    $ git clone git@github.com:soomla/soomla-cocos2dx-core.git extensions/soomla-cocos2dx-core

    $ git clone git@github.com:soomla/cocos2dx-store.git extensions/cocos2dx-store
    ```

1. cocos2dx-store uses a [fork](https://github.com/soomla/jansson) of the jansson library for json parsing, clone it into the `external` directory at the root of your cocos2d-x framework.
    ```
    $ git clone git@github.com:soomla/jansson.git external/jansson
    ```

1. Create your own implementation of `CCStoreAssets` in order to describe your specific game's assets ([example](https://github.com/soomla/cocos2dx-store-example/blob/master/Classes/MuffinRushAssets.cpp)).

1. Make sure to include the `Cocos2dxStore.h` header whenever you use any of the *cocos2dx-store* functions:
    ```cpp
    #include "Cocos2dxStore.h"
    ```

1. Initialize `CCSoomla` and `CCSoomlaStore` with the class you just created, a `customSecret` and other params:

    ```cpp
    soomla::CCSoomla::initialize("customSecret");
    ```

    ```cpp
    __Dictionary *storeParams = __Dictionary::create();
    storeParams->setObject(__String::create("ExamplePublicKey"), "androidPublicKey");
    storeParams->setObject(__Bool::create(true), "testPurchases");

    soomla::CCSoomlaStore::initialize(assets, storeParams);
    ```
    - *Custom Secret* - is an encryption secret you provide that will be used to secure your data.
    **Choose the secret wisely. You can't change them after you launch your game!**
    - *Android Public Key* - is the public key given to you from Google. (iOS doesn't have a public key).
    - *Test Purchases* - allows testing IAP on Google Play. (iOS doesn't have this functionality).

    > Initialize `CCSoomlaStore` ONLY ONCE when your application loads.

1. You'll need to subscribe to store events to get notified about in-app purchasing related events. refer to the [Event Handling](https://github.com/soomla/cocos2dx-store#event-handling) section for more information.

The next steps are different for the different platforms.

#### Instructions for iOS

In your XCode project, perform following steps:

1. Add `jansson` (**external/jansson/**) to your project (just add it as a source folder, make sure to check "create group").

1. For the following XCode projects:

 * `Cocos2dXCore.xcodeproj` (**extensions/soomla-cocos2dx-core/**).  
 * `Cocos2dXStore.xcodeproj` (**extensions/cocos2dx-store/**).

    1. Drag them to your project.
    1. Add their targets to your **Build Phases->Target Dependencies**.
    1. Add the *.a of these projects to **Build Phases->Link Binary With Libraries**.

1. Add the following directories to **Build Settings->Header Search Paths** (with `recursive` option):
> This article assumes you have a `cocos2d` folder under your project folder and which either contains the Cocos2d-x framework, or links to to its root folder

 - `$(SRCROOT)/../cocos2d/extensions/soomla-cocos2dx-core/Soomla`
 - `$(SRCROOT)/../cocos2d/extensions/soomla-cocos2dx-core/build/ios/headers`
 - `$(SRCROOT)/../cocos2d/extensions/cocos2dx-store/Soomla`

1. Add `-ObjC` to your project **Build Setting->Other Linker Flags**.

1. Make sure you have these 3 Frameworks linked to your XCode project: **Security, libsqlite3.0.dylib, StoreKit**.

That's it! Now all you have to do is build your XCode project and run your game with cocos2dx-store.

#### Instructions for Android

1. Import cocos2dx-store module into your project's Android.mk by adding the following:
    ```
    LOCAL_WHOLE_STATIC_LIBRARIES += cocos2dx_store_static        # add this line along with your other LOCAL_WHOLE_STATIC_LIBRARIES

    $(call import-module, extensions/cocos2dx-store) # add this line at the end of the file, along with the other import-module calls
    ```

1. Add the following jars from to your android project's classpath:
    - from `extensions/soomla-cocos2dx-core/build/android`
        1. SoomlaAndroidCore.jar
        2. Cocos2dxAndroidCore.jar
        3. square-otto-1.3.2.jar

    - from `extensions/cocos2dx-store/build/android`
        1. SoomlaAndroidStore.jar
        2. Cocos2dxAndroidStore.jar

1. Update your AndroidManifest.xml to include permissions and the SoomlaApp:

    ```xml
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
    <uses-permission android:name="com.android.vending.BILLING"/>

    <application ...
    	       android:name="com.soomla.SoomlaApp">
    	       ...
    </application>
    ```

1. The following steps should be done according to the target billing service:

  ##### Google Play

  1. Add `AndroidStoreGooglePlay.jar` from `extensions/cocos2dx-store/build/android/billing-services/google-play` to your classpath:

  1. Update your AndroidManifest.xml:

      ```xml
      ...
      <uses-permission android:name="com.android.vending.BILLING"/>

      <application ...
          <activity android:name="com.soomla.store.billing.google.GooglePlayIabService$IabActivity"
                    android:theme="@android:style/Theme.Translucent.NoTitleBar.Fullscreen"/>
          <meta-data android:name="billing.service" android:value="google.GooglePlayIabService" />
      </application>
      ```

  ##### Amazon

  1. Add `in-app-purchasing-2.0.1.jar` and `AndroidStoreAmazon.jar` from `extensions/cocos2dx-store/build/android/billing-services/amazon` to your classpath:

  1. Update your manifest:

      ```xml
      ...
      <receiver android:name = "com.amazon.device.iap.ResponseReceiver" >
      <intent-filter>
          <action android:name = "com.amazon.inapp.purchasing.NOTIFY"
                  android:permission = "com.amazon.inapp.purchasing.Permission.NOTIFY" />
      </intent-filter>
      </receiver>
      <meta-data android:name="billing.service" android:value="amazon.AmazonIabService" />
      ```

That's it! Don't forget to run the **build_native.sh** script so cocos2dx-store sources will be built with cocos2d-x.

#### (optional on Android and Google Play) Starting IAB Service in the background

If you have your own storefront implemented inside your game, it's recommended that you open the IAB Service in the background when the store opens and close it when the store is closed.

C++
```cpp
// Start Iab Service
#if (CC_TARGET_PLATFORM == CC_PLATFORM_ANDROID)
	CCSoomlaStore::getInstance()->startIabServiceInBg();
#endif

// Stop Iab Service
#if (CC_TARGET_PLATFORM == CC_PLATFORM_ANDROID)
	CCSoomlaStore::getInstance()->stopIabServiceInBg();
#endif
```

Don't forget to close the Iab Service when your store is closed. You don't have to do this at all, this is just an optimization.

And that's it! You now have storage and in-app purchasing capabilities.

## What's next? In App Purchasing.

When we implemented modelV3, we were thinking about ways that people buy things inside apps. We figured out many ways you can let your users purchase items in your game and we designed the new modelV3 to support 2 of them: `CCPurchaseWithMarket` and `CCPurchaseWithVirtualItem`.

- **CCPurchaseWithMarket** is a `CCPurchaseType` that allows users to purchase a `CCVirtualItem` with Google Play or the App Store.
- **CCPurchaseWithVirtualItem** is a `CCPurchaseType` that lets your users purchase a `CCVirtualItem` with another `CCVirtualItem`. For example: Buying a sword with 100 gems.

In order to define the way your various virtual items are purchased, you'll need to create your implementation of `CCStoreAssets` (the same one from step 5 in the [Getting Started](https://github.com/soomla/cocos2dx-store#getting-started) section above).

Here is an example:

Lets say you have a `CCVirtualCurrencyPack` you want to call `TEN_COINS_PACK` and a `CCVirtualCurrency` you want to call `COIN_CURRENCY` (`TEN_COINS_PACK` will hold 10 pieces of the currency `COIN_CURRENCY`):

```cpp
#define COIN_CURRENCY_ITEM_ID "coin_currency"
#define TEN_COIN_PACK_ITEM_ID       "ten_coin_pack"
#define TEN_COIN_PACK_PRODUCT_ID    "10_coins_pack"  // this is the product id from the developer console

CCVirtualCurrency *COIN_CURRENCY = CCVirtualCurrency::create(
	String::create("COIN_CURRECY"),
	String::create(""),
	String::create(COIN_CURRENCY_ITEM_ID)
);

CCVirtualCurrencyPack *TEN_COIN_PACK = CCVirtualCurrencyPack::create(
	String::create("10 Coins"),
	String::create("A pack of 10 coins"),
	String::create(TEN_COIN_PACK_ITEM_ID),
	Integer::create(10),
	String::create(COIN_CURRENCY_ITEM_ID),
	CCPurchaseWithMarket::create(String::create(TEN_COIN_PACK_PRODUCT_ID), Double::create(0.99))
);
```

Now you can use `CCStoreInventory` to buy your new currency pack:

    soomla::CCStoreInventory::sharedStoreInventory()->buyItem(TEN_COIN_PACK_ITEM_ID);

And that's it! cocos2dx-store knows how to contact Google Play or the App Store for you and will redirect your users to the purchasing system to complete the transaction. Don't forget to subscribe to store events in order to get notified of successful or failed purchases (see [Event Handling](https://github.com/soomla/cocos2dx-store#event-handling)).

## Storage & Meta-Data

`CCStoreInventory` and `CCStoreInfo` are important storage and metadata classes you should use when you want to perform all store operations:
* `CCStoreInventory` is a convenience class to let you perform operations on `CCVirtualCurrencies` and `CCVirtualGood`s. Use it to fetch/change the balances of `CCVirtualItem`s in your game (using their ItemIds!)  
* `CCStoreInfo` is where all meta data information about your specific game can be retrieved. It is initialized with your implementation of `CCStoreAssets` and you can use it to retrieve information about your specific game.

The on-device storage is encrypted and kept in a SQLite database. SOOMLA has a [cloud-based](http://dashboard.soom.la) storage service (The SOOMLA Highway) that allows this SQLite to be synced to a cloud-based repository that you define.

**Example Usages**

* Get all the `CCVirtualCurrencies`:

    ```cpp
    CCArray *vcArray = soomla::CCStoreInfo::sharedStoreInfo()->getVirtualCurrencies();
    ```

* Give the user 10 pieces of a virtual currency with itemId "currency_coin":

    ```cpp
    soomla::CCStoreInventory::sharedStoreInventory()->giveItem("currency_coin", 10);
    ```

* Take 10 virtual goods with itemId "green_hat":

    ```cpp
    soomla::CCStoreInventory::sharedStoreInventory()->takeItem("green_hat", 10);
    ```

* Get the current balance of green hats (virtual goods with itemId "green_hat"):

    ```cpp
    int greenHatsBalance = soomla::CCStoreInventory::sharedStoreInventory()->getItemBalance("green_hat");
    ```

## Event Handling

SOOMLA lets you subscribe to store events, get notified and implement your own application specific behaviour to them.

> Your behaviour is an addition to the default behaviour implemented by SOOMLA. You don't replace SOOMLA's behaviour.

SOOMLA uses the Cocos2d-x [`EventDispatcher`](http://www.cocos2d-x.org/wiki/EventDispatcher_Mechanism) to dispatch its own custom events.
The names of such events are defined in `CCStoreConsts`, the received event has a `__Dictionary` set in its `userData` which holds all the meta-data for the event.
You can subscribe to any event from anywhere in your code.

For example here's how to subscribe to the item purchased event:

```cpp
cocos2d::Director::getInstance()->getEventDispatcher()->addCustomEventListener(soomla::CCStoreConsts::EVENT_ITEM_PURCHASED, CC_CALLBACK_1(ExampleScene::onItemPurchased, this));
```

Continuing the example, here's how you would handle and extract data from such an event:

```cpp
void ExampleScene::onItemPurchased(cocos2d::EventCustom *event) {
  cocos2d::__Dictionary *eventData = (cocos2d::__Dictionary *)event->getUserData();
  soomla::CCPurchasableVirtualItem *purchasable = dynamic_cast<soomla::CCPurchasableVirtualItem *>(eventData->objectForKey(soomla::CCStoreConsts::DICT_ELEMENT_PURCHASABLE));
  cocos2d::__String *payload = dynamic_cast<cocos2d::__String *>(eventData->objectForKey(soomla::CCStoreConsts::DICT_ELEMENT_DEVELOPERPAYLOAD));

  // Use purchasable and payload for your needs
}
```

Each event has its own meta-data, see inline documentation in [`CCStoreEventDispatcher`](https://github.com/soomla/cocos2dx-store/blob/master/Soomla/CCStoreEventDispatcher.h) for more information.

## Error Handling

Since Cocos2d-x doesn't support exceptions, we use a different method to catch and work with exceptions on the native side. All functions that raise an exception on the native side have an additional *CCError*** parameter to them. In order to know if an exception was raised, send a reference to *CCError** to the function, and inspect it after running.

For example, if I want to purchase an item with the ItemID `huge_sword`, and check if all went well after the purchase, I would call `CCSoomlaStore::buyItem()`, like this:

```c++
soomla::CCError *err;
soomla::CCStoreInventory::sharedStoreInventory()->buyItem("huge_sword", &err);
if (err != NULL) {
    int code = err->getCode();
    switch code {
        case SOOMLA_EXCEPTION_ITEM_NOT_FOUND:
            // itemNotFoundException was raised
            break;
        case SOOMLA_EXCEPTION_INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS:
            // insufficienFundsException was raised
            break;
        case SOOMLA_EXCEPTION_NOT_ENOUGH_GOODS:
            // notEnoughGoodsException was raised
            break;
    }
}
```

You can choose to handle each exception on its own, handle all three at once, or not handle the exceptions at all. The `CCError` parameter is entirely optional, you can pass NULL instead if you do not wish to handle errors, but remember, error handling is *your* responsibility. cocos2dx-store doesn't do any external error handling (i.e. error handling that uses `CCError`) for you.

## iOS Server Side Verification

As you probably know, fraud on IAP is pretty common. Hackers can crack their smartphones to think that a purchase is made when payment wasn't actually transferred to you. We want to help you with it so we created our verification server and we let you instantly use it through the framework.
All you need to do is let cocos2dx-store know you want to verify purchases. You can do this by passing an extra parameter to `CCSoomlaStore`:

```cpp
storeParams->setObject(Bool::create(true), "SSV");
soomla::CCSoomlaStore::initialize(assets, storeParams);
```

## Debugging

You can enable debug logging in cocos2dx-store by setting `SOOMLA_DEBUG` in `CCSoomlaUtils.h` to `true`. Debug logging can also be enabled at build time by adding `-DSOOMLA_DEBUG=1` to `APP_CPPFLAGS` in your `Application.mk` on Android, or by setting `SOOMLA_DEBUG=1` in your Build Settings' `Preprocessor Macros` on iOS.

If you want to see debug messages from _android-store_, set the `logDebug` variable in `com.soomla.store.StoreConfig` to `true`.

To see debug messages on iOS, make sure you have also `DEBUG=1` in your Build Settings' `Preprocessor Macros` (for Debug only).


## Working with sources

We try to do all our best to make your contributions as easy as it's possible. We prepared "sourced" environment for you if you wish to contribute in soomla projects. In order to get it you should:

1. Fetch submodules of repositories, you can do it by recursively cloning them:
    ```
    $ git clone --recursive git@github.com:soomla/soomla-cocos2dx-core.git extensions/soomla-cocos2dx-core
    $ git clone --recursive git@github.com:soomla/cocos2dx-store.git extensions/cocos2dx-store
    ```
or, if you have repositories already cloned, fetch the submodules with this command:
    ```
    $ git submodule update --init --recursive
    ```
> You should run this command in every repository.

1. For iOS: Use sourced versions of Linked projects (`extensions/soomla-cocos2dx-core/development/Cocos2dxCoreFromSources.xcodeproj`, `extensions/cocos2dx-store/development/Cocos2dxStoreFromSources.xcodeproj`)

1. For Android: You can use our "sourced" modules for Android Studio (or IntelliJ IDEA) (`extensions/soomla-cocos2dx-core/development/Cocos2dxCoreFromSources.iml`, `extensions/cocos2dx-store/development/Cocos2dxStoreFromSources.iml`), just include them to your project.

## How to move from v4.3.x to v4.5.x?

Version 4.5.x is all about making the integration process on iOS and Android easier.
If you are using v4.3.x and want to move to v4.4.x follow these steps:

1. Pull the latest version to your `extensions` folder
1. Remove any Soomla-related code in iOS (`AppController.mm`) and Android (`Cocos2dxActivity`), especially code related to `ServiceManager` and any other `Service`s.
1. In your AppDelegate.cpp:
  - Change `soomla::CCServiceManager::getInstance()->setCommonParams(commonParams);` to `soomla::CCSoomla::initialize("customSecret");`
  - Change `soomla::CCStoreService::initShared(assets, storeParams);` to `soomla::CCSoomlaStore::initialize(assets, storeParams);`
  - Remove any `#include`s to missing header files, you only need `Cocos2dxStore.h`
1. Remove any reference to `EventHandler`s and subscribing through Soomla `EventDispatcher`s, instead use the Cocos2d-x `EventDispatcher` to subscribe to events.
1. When in doubt follow the [cocos2dx-store-example](https://github.com/soomla/cocos2dx-store#example-project)`
