*This project is a part of The [SOOMLA](http://www.soom.la) Framework, which is a series of open source initiatives with a joint goal to help mobile game developers do more together. SOOMLA encourages better game design, economy modeling, social engagement, and faster development.*

soomla-cocos2dx-core
===============

When using the SOOMLA framework, you always start by initializing the core module:
```c++
    soomla::CCSoomla::initialize("customSecret");
```

This sets up the local on-device database used by SOOMLA.  The secret is used for encrypting the data, make sure to choose a good one.

This core library holds common features and utilities used by all other modules of the SOOMLA framework.
It includes:
* An encrypted key-value storage (SQLite based) for persisting data locally on devices.
* Utilities for JSON and __Dictionary manipulation.
* Utilities for Logging and encryption.
* Reward domain objects and events - used to grant your users rewards.

SOOMLA modules internally use these features, though we encourage you to use them for your own needs as well.  For example, use our key-value storage for custom game data for usage across game sessions.

You can start by using the more common features in core by including the `Cocos2dxCore.h` header.
````cpp
  #include "Cocos2dxCore.h"
````
